- Numerical approximations of ODE systems. 

- Written in a way that's easy to add new systems and methods. 

- It produces a file which contains the following data for visualization
	t | x1 | x2 | x3 | v1 | v2 | v3

** CURRENT: rk4-method / motion in: . Constant EM field 
				    . Homog. Grav. field with drag force 
				    . Anisotropic 3D Harmonic Oscillator 
			            . Double pendulum

** GOAL   : Creation of a mini library which will solve numerically different physical problems with various methods.
